* Today
  * We reviewd the progress.
    * The progress using canvas is v good.
  * We discussed again the approach from https://dahoum.wales/the-pacman-as-a-nursery-32ba07b282b1 and agreed that we will re-start the project w/o canvas and w/o animated PacMan, and we will not use CSS animation.
* Homework
  * Show only the part of the labyrinth w/ the dots.
  * Show one phase of the PacMan on top of it.
  * Re-wire the movement of the PacMan w/ the keyboard.
  * Think how to animate the PacMan using the phases/ costumes on the spritesheet and JavaScript (no CSS animations).
* w/ T. E. weekly w/ mentor more often
* We began on 14 March 2023
